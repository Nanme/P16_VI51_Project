Subject 1: Simulation of Drones

Tutor: StÃ©phane Galland & Franck Gechter

Drone becomes a means of transport for goods in cities. This project is interesting
about modelling and simulation the drones moving in a city.

This project aims to carry out a software of simulation of drones in a city. You will
have to propose a model and software allowing to simulate the behaviors of drones.
Simulation will stop when there is no more drone to simulate.

Mandatory Elements:

1. environment model
2. movement behaviours

Optional Elements:

1. Path Planning
2. Graphical User Interface

How to :
  - Work with Eclipse SARL on Windows :
    1. First download Eclipse SARL for your architecture of Windows here : http://www.sarl.io/download/index.html
    2. Extract it in the folder of your choice.
    2. Dowload Janus project here and put it at the root of your Eclipse SARL : http://www.janusproject.io/
    3. Start SARL (as admin if necessary).
    4. Go to Window > Preferences > SARL > Installed SREs.
    5. Add the janus project JAR as an SRE.
    6. Now you can create a SARL project !
